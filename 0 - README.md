# AirPollutionPoland_timeseries_analysis

The purpose of the project is to veryfy whether air pollution could be successfully modeled using time series approach.
This repository presents air pollution modeling with time series using Python. The step-by-step methodology included here, has been enriched with a practical commentary. 
The mathematical formalism behind each model has been purposely omitted; only basic knowledge of the subject is required. 
The composition of the analysis was arranged according to the increasing level of complexity. The models mentioned above are:

 - AR - autoregressive;
 - MA - movig average;
 - ARMA - autoregressive moving average;
 - SARMA - seasonal autoregressive moving average;
 - ARIMA - autoregressive integrated moving average;
 - SARIMA - seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average;
 - ARIMAX - autoregressive moving average with exogenous variable (model is being prepared);
 - SARIMAX - seasonal autoregressive moving average with exogenous variable (model is being prepared);
 - ARCH - autoregressive condition heteroscedasticity (model is being prepared);
 - AUTOARIMA;
 - FB Prophet - package provided by Facebook (prototype).
 
In addition to the above, the repository includes:
  - the way to connect to the API of the Chief Inspectorate of Environmental Protection in Poland (GIOÅš);
  - method of connecting MS SQL database and Python;
  - T-SQL query containing execution (megre / join 3 tables, data transform, creating geography coordinates);
  - link to the created map in TableauPublic.

It is still in progress.
